A Declaration By the Representatives of the United States of America, in General
Congress Assembled.
When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a people to advance from
that subordination in which they have hitherto remained, and to assume among powers of
the earth the equal and independent station to which the laws of nature and of nature's
god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the change.
We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal and independent;
that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent and inalienable, among which are
the preservation of life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these
ends, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just power from the consent
of the governed; that whenever any form of government shall become destructive of these
ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government,
laying it's foundation on such principles and organizing it's power in such form, as to
them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence indeed will
dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient
causes: and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to
suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, begun at a
distinguished period, and pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce
them to arbitrary power, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and
to provide new guards for future security. Such has been the patient sufferings of the
colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge their former
systems of government. the history of his present majesty is a history of unremitting
injuries and usurpations, among which no one fact stands single or solitary to contradict
the uniform tenor of the rest, all of which have in direct object the establishment of an
absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world,
for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood.
